# Typetype Online Text Editor(s)

Typetype is a site for online browser-based text editors. It is ultra minimal, built entirely out of HTML and CSS (okay, there's a few lines of javascript.) Just type. To save, File > Save As.

Suggestions, themes, forks, pull requests, etc accepted.

This is not a 'robust' project. It's mostly just CSS and takes advantage of *contenteditable*.
